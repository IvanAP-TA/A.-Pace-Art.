# ðŸŒŸ Social Links Enhancement Implementation

## Project: DarkCanvas Gallery
**Date:** June 11, 2025  
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETED - Social links visibility successfully enhanced

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Addressed

The original implementation had social media links hidden in the footer, making them difficult to discover. Users rarely scroll to the footer, resulting in poor social media engagement and missed opportunities for followers.
